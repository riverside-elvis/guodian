[^1-27]: Or, if we see 
[虍 radical containing 且 and 心 vertically within]
as an error for 慮 after all, perhaps
"forsake ingenuity and abandon deliberation".

[^1-28]: Or, if 季子 is seen as an error for 孝子(慈):
"the people will return to filial piety and parental affection".

[^1-150]: The subject of 知足,
"knowing what is enough,"
is not entirely clear.
HR 00 supplies "you,"
i.e., the ruler to whom the passage is addressed,
whereas I take the subject to be the "myriad things."

[^1-156]: Or, if we follow Wang Bi in attributing 猶 to 聖人:
"Even the sage is troubled by it" (cf. HR 00).

[^1-187]: Or, as HR 00 translates and as many understand it,
"ugliness comes into being" (likewise for the next sentence).

[^1-188]: Cf. HR 00:
"He does things for them, but he does not make them dependent."

[^1-218]: HR 00 translates
"No one causes this to be so;
of itself it falls equally on them,"
apparently taking the 民, "people,"
as both the non-causing subject and recipient of Heaven's dew.
LMC 03.6 and LZ 03.12 interpret similarly
(note that these readings assume 焉 at the end of this phrase).

[^1-219]: Compare again HR 00,
who logically (but against the subsequent rhyme)
groups this line (minus the 焉) with the next stanza:
"When we start to 'regulate' or 'put into order' there will be names."
See also LD 82: "Only when it is cut are there names";
RM 01: "But the advent of rule brought names";
and AR/HDL 03: "When we start to regulate the world, we introduce names."
This is a relatively standard interpretation;
among others, both GY 01.2 and LZ 03.12 offer similar readings of this line.

[^1-336]: HR 00 suggests that these two lines might refer back, respectively,
to the first two lines of this passage.

[^1-364]: Given the ambiguities of 祥 and 強,
it is also possible to read these two lines positively:
"Augmenting life we call 'good augury';
the mind directing the vital energy we call 'potency'"---but
this would be hard to reconcile with the final two lines
and would seem out of character with the work's
treatment of "mind," qi, and "strength" more generally.
But cf. RM 01:
"Enhancing life means good fortune;
Mind controlling spirit means inner strength."

[^1-93]: Note that "virtue" and "potency" in this passage
translate the same term, de 德
(normally rendered "virtue" elsewhere in these translations).

[^2-39]: For somewhat different renderings of these lines,
see HR 00 and AS 03 (p. 280).

[^2-59]: Or alternatively, "be entrusted with," as AS 03 has it.
