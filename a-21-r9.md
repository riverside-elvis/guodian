## A 21 (R 9)

持而盈之
不若已
Rather than filling it to the brim while propping it up,
it is better to desist.

漙而羣之
不可長保也
If you amass things in profusion,
you cannot for long preserve them.

金玉盈室
莫能守也
When bronzes and jades fill your chamber,
you will not be able to maintain them.

貴富［而］驕
自遺咎也
To be arrogant in nobility and wealth
is to bequeath yourself with retribution.

功遂身退
天之道也
To recede in the wake of successful accomplishments,
that is the Way of Heaven.
