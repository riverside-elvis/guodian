# Laozi C

## C 1 (R 17-18)

太上下
知有之
The best [scenario] is for those below
to [merely] know [the ruler] exists.

其次
親譽之
Down from that is [for them]
to hold him dear and praise him.

其次
畏之
Down from that is [for them]
to fear him.

其次
侮之
Down from that is [for them]
to disrespect him.

信不足
焉有不信
Where trust is lacking [in the ruler],
[the people] will consequently lack trust [in him]---
猶乎
其貴言也
deliberatively,
should he place value on his words!

成事
遂功
而百姓曰
He [would thus] accomplish affairs
and brings achievements to fruition,
yet the people [would all] say:
我自然也
"I did this myself."

故大道廢
焉有仁義
Thus only where the great Way is abandoned
do humanity and propriety come into being.

六親不和
焉有孝慈
Only where the six relations are in disharmony
do filial piety and parental affection come into being.

邦家昏［亂］
［焉］有正臣
[Only where] the states and households are in [turmoil]
do upright ministers come into being.
