## B 5 (R 41)

上士聞道
僅能行於其中
When the "highest" gentleman hears of the Way,
he is barely able to operate within it.

中士聞道
若聞
若忘
When the gentleman of the "middle" hears of the Way,
it is as if now heard
and now forgotten.

下士聞道
大笑之
When the "lower" gentleman hears of the Way,
he gives it a great laugh---
弗大笑
不足以為道矣
for without that great laugh,
it is unworthy to be taken as the Way.

是以建言有之
Thus an established saying has it:

明道
如昧
"The enlightened Way
seems shrouded;
夷道
如纇
the smooth Way
seems bumpy;
［進］道

the Way of [advancement]
seems to retreat.

上德
如谷
The highest virtue
is like a valley;
大白
如辱
great purity
seems sullied;

seems insufficient.

健德
如［偷］
Vigorous potency
seems [indolent];
［質］貞
如渝
[chaste] devotion
seems fickle;
大方
亡隅

lacks corners.

大器
（曼/縵）成
Great vessels
(remain imperfected);

道［隱］

[and lacks renown]."
