## I 1-8c

是故太一
藏於水
行於時
Thus the Great Unity
is stored in water
and mobilized in the four seasons:

周而又［始］
［以□為］萬物母
Cycling and [beginning] anew,
[it thereby...as] the mother of the myriad things.

一缺一盈
以紀為萬物經
Alternately empty and full,
it thereby weaves together as the warp of the myriad things.

此天之所不能殺
地之所不能埋
陰陽之所不能成
This is something which Heaven cannot destroy,
Earth cannot bury,
and to which _yin_ and _yang_ cannot give final form.

君子知
此之謂［聖□□□□□］
When a noble man knows this,
this is what we call ["sagacity"].
