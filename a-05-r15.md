## A 5 (R 15)

古之善為士者
必微妙玄達
深不可識
Those of old skilled at being men of service
were invariably subtle and profound,
deep and indescribable.

是以為之容
Thus we create a demeanor for them:

豫乎
Tentative---
如冬涉川
as though crossing a stream in winter.

猶乎
Hesitant---
其如畏四鄰
as though in fear of surrounding neighbors.

嚴乎
Austere---
其如客
as if a guest.

遠乎
Distant---
其如釋
as if breaking away.

純乎
Genuine---
其如樸
like uncarved wood.

沌乎
Turbid---
其如濁
like muddy water.

孰能濁以靜者
將徐清
Whoever can be muddy with tranquility
will slowly become clear;
孰能庇以動者
將徐生
whoever can be sheltered with movement
will slowly enliven.

保此道者
不欲尚盈
Those who preserve this way
desire not to overfill.
