## C 4 (R 64b)

為之者
敗之
He who acts with purpose upon it
will ruin it;
執之者
失之
he who clings to it
will lose it.

聖人無為
故無敗也
The sage acts to no purpose,
so brings no ruin;
無執
故［無失也］
clings to nothing,
so [has no loss].

慎終若始
則無敗事矣
If one treats the end as cautiously as the beginning,
one will bring ruin to no task.

人之敗也
恆於其且成也
敗之
When people ruin something,
they constantly do so
while on the verge of accomplishing it.

是以［聖］人
欲不欲
不貴難得之貨
Thus the [sage]
desires not to desire,
placing no value on hard-to-obtain goods;
（學）不（學）
復眾之所過
(learns) not to (learn/emulate),
turning back from the excesses of the masses.

是以能（輔）
萬物之自然
而弗敢為
Thus he can (assist/join)
in the spontaneity of the myriad things,
but dares not act upon them.
