# Laozi B

## B 1 (R 59)

治人
事天
莫若嗇
In putting people in order
and serving [one's own] nature,
there is nothing better than storing up.

夫唯嗇
是以早備
For only by storing up
can you be prepared in advance.

［早備］
是謂
［重積徳］
[Advanced preparation]
is what is known as
["heavily accumulating virtue."]

［重積德］
［則無］不克
[If you heavily accumulate virtue],
[there will be nothing] you will not overcome.

無不克
則莫知其極
If there is nothing you do not overcome,
no one will know your limits.

莫知其極
可以有國
If no one knows your limits,
you may possess the realm.

有國之母
可以長［久］
Possessing the "mother" of the realm,
you can long [endure].

［是謂］
［深根固柢］
長生久視之道也
[This is what is known as]
["deep roots and a solid base,"]
the way to long life and enduring awareness.
