# Appendix: Transcriber's Notes

This is Scott Cook's
base text and translation
of the Guodian Laozi
from _The Bamboo Texts of Guodian_, 2012.

I've extracted just modern characters
from Cook's base text,
and the phrasing of the base text
is informed by the punctuation and phrasing
of Cook's English translation.

Markdown resources and a build script are on
[GitHub](https://github.com/riverside-elvis/guodian).
