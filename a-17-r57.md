## A 17 (R 57)

以正之邦
以奇用兵
以亡事取天下
Manage the state with conventional means,
employ soldiers with extraordinary ones,
[but] capture the world through absence of intent.

吾何以知其然也
How do I know that this is so?

夫天多忌諱
而民彌叛
The more restrictions and prohibitions in the land,
the more the people will rebel.

民多利器
而邦滋昏
The more sharp implements the people have,
the more the state will be in turmoil.[^1-336]

人多知
而奇物滋起
The more knowledge the people have,
the more outlandish things will arise.

法物滋彰
盜賊多有
If ideal goods are displayed in abundance,
thieves and thugs will be many.

是以聖人之言曰
Thus the words of the sage state:

我無事
而民自富
"I serve no end
and the people prosper on their own.

我無為
而民自化
I act to no purpose
and the people transform of themselves.

我好靜
而民自正
I am fond of tranquility
and the people of themselves are rectified.

我欲不欲
而民自樸
I desire the lack of desire
and the people of themselves become innocent."
