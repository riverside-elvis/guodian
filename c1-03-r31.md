## C 3 (R 31)

君子居
則貴左
In repose,
the noble man values the left;
用兵
則貴右
when employing weapons,
he values the right.

故曰
Thus is it said:
兵者［不祥之器也］
"Weapons [are inauspicious implements]."

［不］得已而用之
銛功為上
弗美也
If their use [cannot] be avoided,
it is best to [simply] make them sharp and sturdy,
and not [ornamentally] beautify them.

美之是樂殺人
To beautify them is to delight in killing others.

夫樂［殺者］
［不可］以得志於天下
For [those who] delight in [killing others]
[will be unable to] have their way in the world.

故吉事
尚左
Thus in auspicious affairs,
one esteems the left;
喪事
尚右
in mournful affairs,
one esteems the right.

是以
偏將軍居左
上將軍居右
Thus
the deputy commander takes the left,
while the top commander takes the right---
言以喪禮居之也
this speaks to how [these positions] are taken
in accordance with the mourning rituals.

故殺［人眾］
則以哀悲蒞之
Thus when [many people] are killed,
[one should] approach this with sorrow;
戰勝
則以喪禮居之
when victorious in battle,
[one should] take it
in accordance with the mourning rituals.
