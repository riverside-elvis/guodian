## A 11 (R 32B)

天地相合也
以逾甘露
Heaven and Earth join together,
so as to send down sweet dew.

民
莫之命天
而自均
The people,
under mandate from no one,
balance themselves out[^1-218]---
焉始制有名
only at this are names produced.[^1-219]

名亦既有
夫亦將知止
Once names are present,
so too shall their limits be known.

知止所以不殆
It is by knowing their limits that peril is shunned.

譬道之在天下也
Thus may the Way's existence in the world be compared:
猶小谷之與江海
to small streams [flowing in]to a River or Sea.
