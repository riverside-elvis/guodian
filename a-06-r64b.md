## A 6 (R 64b)

為之者
敗之
He who acts with purpose upon it
will ruin it;
執之者
失之
he who clings to it
will lose it.

是以聖人
亡為
故亡敗
Thus the sage
acts to no purpose,
so brings no ruin;
亡執
故亡失
clings to nothing,
so has no loss.

臨事之紀
慎終如始
The essentials of overseeing a task [lie in]
treating the end as cautiously as the beginning---
此亡敗事矣
with this, one will bring ruin to no task.

聖人
欲不欲
不貴難得之貨
The sage
desires not to desire,
placing no value on hard-to-obtain goods;
（學/放）不（學/放）
復眾之所過
(learns) not to (learn/emulate),
turning back from the excesses of the masses.

是故聖人
能（輔）萬物之自然
而弗能為
Thus the sage
can (assist/join) in the spontaneity of the myriad things,
but he cannot act upon them.
