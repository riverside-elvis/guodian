# Laozi A

## A 1 (R 19)

絕智
棄辨
民利百倍
Forsake knowledge
and abandon discrimination,
and the people will benefit a hundred fold.

絕巧
棄利
盜賊亡有
Forsake skill
and abandon profit,
and thieves and thugs will cease to exist.

絕偽
棄詐
民復稚子
Forsake ingenuity
and abandon deception,[^1-27]
and the people will once again [become as] young children.[^1-28]

三言以為吏不足
又命之有所樹
As things to abide by, [these] three phrases are insufficient,
and [so we] further add to them something constructive:
示素保樸
manifest the plain and embrace the unhewn;
少私寡欲
lessen self-interest and decrease desires.
