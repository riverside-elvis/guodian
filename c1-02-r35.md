## C 2 (R 35)

設大象
天下往
Hold forth the great model,
and the world will come along.

往而不害
焉平太
Coming along without impair,
it will be steady and secure.

樂與餌
過客止
[Whereas] music and repast,
will [merely] stay the passing guest.

故道［之出言］
淡兮其無味也
Thus [words that come forth of] the Way,
how bland and tasteless are they!

視之
不足見
Looking at [the Way],
it is not worth seeing;
聽之
不足聞
listening to it,
it is not worth hearing;
而不可既也
and yet it cannot be exhausted.
