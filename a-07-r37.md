## A 7 (R 37)

道恆亡為也
The Way constantly acts to no purpose;
侯王能守之
而萬物將自化
should lords and kings be able to uphold it,
the myriad things will transform of themselves.

化
而欲作
將貞之以亡名之樸
夫亦
將知足
If,
transforming,
[things] should desire to originate,
they shall be steadied with the nameless unhewn,
and so, too,
shall they be made to know what is enough.[^1-150]

知［足］
以靜
萬物將自定
Knowing [what is enough],
and thus tranquil,
the myriad things shall become settled of themselves.
