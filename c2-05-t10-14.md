## II 10-14

下
土也
而謂之地
Below,
it is soil,
and this is called Earth;
上
氣也
而謂之天
above,
it is fluid energy (*qi*),
and this is called Heaven.

道亦其字也
"The Way" is merely its designation---
請問
其名
what, may I ask,
is its name?

以道從事者
必託其名
故事成
而身長
Those who use the Way to carry things out
must entrust \[themselves to][^2-59] its name,
and thus their tasks are successful
and their persons long[-lived].

聖人之從事也
亦託其名
故功成
而身不傷
When sages carry things out,
they also entrust [themselves to] its name,
and thus their achievements are successful
and their persons not injured.

天地名字
並立
The names and designations of Heaven and Earth
stand side by side;
故過其方
不思相［尚］
thus though they may exceed their domains,
they seek not to [surpass] each other.

［天不足］於西北
其下高以強
[Heaven is deficient] in the northwest,
[but] that below it is high and strong.

地不足於東南
其上［厚以廣］
Earth is deficient in the southeast,
[but] that above it is [deep(?) and vast(?)].

［不足於上］者
有餘於下
That which [is deficient above]
has a surplus below;
不足於下者
有餘於上
that which is deficient below
has a surplus above.
