## A 9 (R 2)

天下皆
知美之為美也
惡已
When everyone in the world
knows the beautiful as beautiful,
it turns ugly.[^1-187]

皆知善
此其不善已
When they all know the good [as such],
it turns to no good.

有亡
之相生也
Such is the mutual generation
of presence and absence,
難易
之相成也
the mutual completion
of the difficult and easy,
長短
之相形也
the mutual formation
of the long and short,
高下
之相盈也
the mutual fulfillment
of the high and low,
音聲
之相和也
the mutual harmonizing
of tones and voices,
先後
之相隨也
the mutual pursuit
of what precedes and what follows.

是以聖人
居亡為之事
行不言之教
Thus the sage
engages in matters that act to no purpose,
carries out teachings that utter no words.

萬物作
而弗始也
The myriad things arise,
but [he] does not originate them;
為
而弗恃也
act,
but [he] does not rely upon them.[^1-188]

成
而弗居
[He] accomplishes,
but does not dwell in this.

夫唯弗居也
是以弗去也
For only because he does not dwell in it,
does it not go away.
