## A 18 (R 55)

含德之厚者
比於赤子
One who harbors an abundance of virtue
may be compared to an infant boy:

虺蠆蟲蛇
弗蠚
Vipers, scorpions, insects, and snakes
will not bite or sting him;
攫鳥猛獸
弗搏
birds of prey and ferocious beasts
will not attack and seize him.

骨弱筋柔
而捉固
His bones are weak and his sinews soft,
yet his grip is firm;
未知牝牡之合
［而］朘怒
he knows not yet of the union between female and male,
[yet] his phallus rouses---
精之至也
this is the height of vitality.

終日號
而不嗄
He cries all day,
yet does not grow hoarse---
和之至也
this is the height of harmony.

和
曰常
Harmony,
we call "constancy";
知和
曰明
knowing harmony,
we call "perspicacity."

益生
曰祥
Augmenting life
we call "[ill?] augury";
心使氣
曰強
the mind directing the vital energy
we call "forced[?] potency."[^1-364]

物壯則老
When things become robust,
they age;
是謂
不道
this is what we mean by
"off the Way."
